function image = gammaMap(image, isoVal)
    % I did some testing on the gamma map function. I found that darker
    % images, which have a higher ISO value than lighter images, 
    % (for example, newyear.csv shows a ISO value of 3200, while apples
    % shows an ISO value of 1600), need a higher value of gamma for the
    % gammaMapping. I took apples to be the baseline assumption
    % case. Using this image, I found a good gamma mapping value
    % Working backwards, I used another image's baseline value (yosemite)
    % to create an equation for gamma in terms of the iso value. 
    
    % if image is relatively light, perform minimal gamma mapping:
%     if (isoVal > 300) 
%         gamma1 = 1.2;
%     else
        % calculate gamma based partially on the inputted ISO value from 
        % .csv data
%         gamma1 = (isoVal./200);
%     end
    
    % map the image accordingly: 
    imgGamma1 = 0.image.^(1./gamma1);
    
    % return gamma mapped image
    image = imgGamma1;
end
